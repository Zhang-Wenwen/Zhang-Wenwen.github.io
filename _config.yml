  Hi, my name is Wenwen Zhang, I'm a MASc student at the University of British Columbia, Canada. 
  I am now working as a research assistant in Flexible Electronics and Energy Lab (FEEL).
  My research focuses on wearable devices and federated learning method considering large proportion of no-label data with huge data heterogeneity at different device end.
  I am very optimistic about the future of wearable devices. I believe the interdisciplinary field which connects the popular machine learning and end devices will be promising. 
  I have worked with a range of different languages (python, MATLAB, C, C++), tried different fields in Electrical Engineering field (microwave components, image process, machie learning), 
  and I am always looking forward to opportunities to work with something new.
  
  If you are interested, please download [my resumé](https://www.google.com/) Here.

          This project explores federated learning method considering large proportion of non-labeled data with significant data heterogeneity at different device end. 
          With the development of wearable sensors, people are able to collect enormous data volume from huge number of individuals. These data always come with huge
          diversity and complexity due to differences in personal habits. And it also takes expensive energy and high cost to label these data. To address these concerns, 
          federated learning is proposed to deal with the unlabeled data and data heterogeneity.

          This project works on lower extremity estimation & movement tracking & muscle condition monitoring by data collected from flexible sensors (stress, temperature, ect.) 
          integrated on knee braces. The emergence of these wearable devices enable the possibility to monitor personal health status by daily activities. What's more, 
          this kind of flexible sensors free people from lab environment with more comprehensive feedback on healthy detection and achieve significant cost savings.

          This project develops real-time algorithms to predict gait parameters of patients with disorders (Parkinson, stroke & geriatric). People with impairment of injury or 
          senior age often suffer from gait disorders which may cause falls or other serious consequences during walk. To control such risks, gait parameters should be to utilized
          and tracked in daily activities to assess the severity of disease.

          This project aims to reconstruct hand gesture of post-stroke patients to assess upper extremity function and help motivate recovery progress. It also has the promise
          to be developed as real-time model for VR & AR game in the future.

          Quantifying measurement errors in wearable inertial measurement unit devices caused by soft tissue movement artifacts is important in all data collection process.
          Soft tissue movement artifacts always bring drift when measuring data from wearable sensors. And the drifts are the most frequent reason responsible for effectiveness
          of developed algorithm. However, by analyzing the different between ground truth and affected, it's possible to get rid of these influence.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
